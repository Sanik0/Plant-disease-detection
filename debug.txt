                <div class="name poppins-medium"> Powdery Mildew</div>
                    Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. Powdery mildew diseases are caused by many different species of ascomycete fungi in the order Erysiphales. Powdery mildew is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as the signs of the causal pathogen are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems.[1] This mycelial layer may quickly spread to cover all of the leaves. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the mildew can appear on any above-ground part of the plant. As the disease progresses, the spots get larger and denser as large numbers of asexual spores are formed, and the mildew may spread up and down the length of the plant.

                    Powdery mildew grows well in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures; greenhouses provide an ideal moist, temperate environment for the spread of the disease. This causes harm to agricultural and horticultural practices where powdery mildew may thrive in a greenhouse setting.[2] In an agricultural or horticultural setting, the pathogen can be controlled using chemical methods, bio-organic methods, and genetic resistance. It is important to be aware of powdery mildew and its management strategies as the resulting disease can significantly reduce important crop yields.[3]

                <div class="name poppins-medium">Furasium Wilt</div>
                    Fusarium wilt is a common vascular wilt fungal disease, exhibiting symptoms similar to Verticillium wilt. This disease has been investigated extensively since the early years of this century. The pathogen that causes Fusarium wilt is Fusarium oxysporum (F. oxysporum).[1] The species is further divided into formae speciales based on host plant.

                    Bhendi yellow vein mosaic virus (BYVMV) or okra yellow vein mosaic (OYVMV) is a viral disease caused by monopartite Begomovirus affecting okra plants.[1][2] It was first found in 1924 in Bombay, India, and Sri Lanka.[3] It is the major limitation of the production of okra.[4] This disease is transmitted by whitefly.

                <div class="name poppins-medium">Cercospora leaf spot</div>
                    Cercospora is a genus of ascomycete fungi. Most species have no known sexual stage, and when the sexual stage is identified, it is in the genus Mycosphaerella.[2] Most species of this genus cause plant diseases, and form leaf spots. It is a relatively well-studied genus of fungi, but there are countless species not yet described, and there is still much to learn about the best-known members of the genus.
